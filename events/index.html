								<p>More than one million Jews, in 65 cities around the world, are joining together to keep the Shabbos of November 11-12th 2016. It is an act of solidarity, a celebration of our Jewish heritage, and an opportunity to reconnect to our families, friends and ourselves.  More than ever, Shabbos is our day of rest. 
There are many ways to get involved. Join your local synagogue for services, create your own Shabbat Table with your guest list and menu custom-made by you, spend the Shabbat at a host family, challenge yourself to detach from your devices for 25 hours. Download both The Toolkit and The Unofficial Guide to Shabbat from our website to learn about the meaning and how-toâ€™s of Shabbos.
If you would like to be a guest at a family for Shabbos, call 773-771-9396 or <a href="mailto:HostMe@ShabbosProjectCHI.com">HostMe@ShabbosProjectCHI.com</a></p>
